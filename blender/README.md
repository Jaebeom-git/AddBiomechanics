# Blender Support

These are scripts to run from inside Blender to load animations, and produce high quality renders.

## Dev Installation

You can setup PyCharm to use your bundled Blender Python interpreter. On Mac, that's located at:

`/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/Resources/3.3/python/bin/python3.10`

Then, you can install the appropriate version of [fake-bpy-model](https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module) to match 
your Blender.
