# Welcome to the AddBiomechanics Command Line Interface

This tool allows you to conveniently upload large datasets to be bulk processed on SLURM by AddBiomechanics, as well as do bulk downloads and collect statistics about datasets.

To install, just run (from the root of this repository):

`pip3 install ./cli`

Then you can use the new `addb` tool on the command line, like so:

`addb upload <path_to_your_folder>`

For more info and other commands:

`addb --help`
